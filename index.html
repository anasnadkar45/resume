    <p>A <b> blockchain </b> is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that consists of growing lists of records, called
        blocks, that are <sub>linked</sub>  together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic
        hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
        data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
        created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare
        linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain
        transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
        retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

        Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed
        ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction
        blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
        considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
